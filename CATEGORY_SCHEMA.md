**1. Category Name (Eg: `Kids`, `Women`, `Men`)**

```

Type: String (Single Text Line)
Constraints: Unique, Required, Title
```

**2. Category Link (Eg: `/category/kids`, `/category/women`)**

```
Name: CategoryLink

```

**4. Category Products**

```

	"categoriesLists": [
		{
			"name": "Clothing",
			"categoryLink": "/category/clothing",
			"categoryImage": {
				"url": "..."
			},
			"products": [
				// list of products beloging to this category
			]
		}
	]
}
```
