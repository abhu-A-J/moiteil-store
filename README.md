# [Moiteil Swag Store](https://moiteil-store.vercel.app/)

üõçÔ∏è A sample **JAMStack E-Commerce Swag Store** crafted using [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/), [**Stitches Dev**](https://www.stitches.dev/) and [**GraphCMS**](https://www.graphcms.com). The application only serves as a starter/ sample work to power your E-Commerce store using JAMStack. The possiblities to customize and launch your own headless Storefront has been been easier.

All the product templates are generated from [**Printful**](https://printful.com/).

The work is deployed on [**Vercel**](https://www.vercel.com/).

**_Feel free to use the project for your own portfolio purposes._**
